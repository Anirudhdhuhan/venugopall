							A steely resolve, single – minded, self respect, extraordinary, forward thinking ability, academic brilliance, conscience, sagacity, a light heart and down to earth attitude – all this together to a superlative degree with an exclamation mark is what defines this true son of the soil. Preetham Nagarigari, the man himself – the one who won laurels for himself, his village, his state and his country wherever he has been. He had a rather impoverished beginning like millions of other Indians, but what sets him apart is the daunting determination to excel, to be better, to be respected and to never ever stoop down before any one, in any possible manner. An egalitarian society has always been Nagarigari Preetham’s Goal. His dream is to consistently persist and strive towards creating a society without poverty and Opportunities divided equally to all, abolish untouchability, humiliations and realizing the vision of prosperous and happy India.

							<br />
							Mr Preetham draws his inspiration from Dr BR Ambedkar who dreamt of society with equality .
